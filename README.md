# Unlocking-Low-Carbon-Economy-Through-Buildings

To combat the threat of climate change, governments around the world have banded together to reduce the world’s carbon emissions. 
For instance, British Columbia (BC) governemt has implemented the CleanBC 2030 Roadmap, which covers various sectors of the economy including but not limited to: transportation, construction, industry, oil & gas, and negative emissions technologies. 
While the roadmap aims to reduce carbon emissions as efficiently as possible, there are issues and concerns lying under each solution in different sectors (eg: economy stops growing) and need to be tackled properly. 

Based on this background, Economics Student Association (ESA) x Vancouver School of Economics Undergradate Society (VSEUS) of the University of British Columbia (UBC) have jointly hosted an intensive 2-day case competition to encourage students to provide solutions to promote green economy.
The question to be answered is: **How Can British Columbia Finance and Implement The Transition to a Low Carbon Economy In a Way That Strengthens BC’s Economy?**

Our team (3 people) presented our solutions to answer this question by focusing on the buildings sector, where we used data analysis and machine learning to analyze the factors that affect a building's carbon efficiency, as well as provided in-depth analysis for each of our proposed solutions.
Please see the PowerPoint for details.
